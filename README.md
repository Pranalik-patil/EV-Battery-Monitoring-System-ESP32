## 📌 Project Overview

Electric vehicles rely heavily on battery performance and safety. Traditional systems often lack real-time monitoring and remote accessibility.

This project presents a **cloud-connected Battery Management System (BMS)** that:

* Monitors **Voltage, Current, Temperature, Humidity, and State of Charge (SOC)**
* Uses **ESP-NOW protocol** for fast wireless communication
* Uploads data to the **cloud (Adafruit IO)** for real-time visualization
* Detects faults and sends alerts for unsafe conditions

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Real-time monitoring of battery parameter
✅ SOC (State of Charge) estimation
✅ Wireless communication using ESP32 (ESP-NOW)
✅ Cloud integration with live dashboard
✅ Fault detection system:

* 🔥 Over-temperature alert
* ⚡ Low battery alert
* 📡 Communication failure detection

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Sensors collect battery parameters:

   * Voltage
   * Current
   * Temperature
   * Humidity

2. ESP32 (Sensor Node):

   * Processes sensor data
   * Sends data wirelessly via ESP-NOW

3. ESP32 (Receiver Node):

   * Receives data
   * Sends acknowledgment (ACK)
   * Detects abnormal conditions

4. Cloud Integration:

   * Data uploaded to Adafruit IO via MQTT
   * Real-time dashboard displays parameters

## 🔋 SOC Calculation

State of Charge is calculated using linear mapping:

[
SOC = \frac{V - V_{min}}{V_{max} - V_{min}} \times 100
]

Where:

* (V_{max} = 4.2V)
* (V_{min} = 3.0V)
